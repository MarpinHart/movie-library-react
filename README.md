# MovieFinder
A movie list displayer.

Web Application built as a challenge and as a React and Material-ui exercise.

I have been using the MovieDB API where an API key is required in order to make the requests.

## Getting Started
- Clone or fork this repository
- In the command line for the project folder

```sh
$ npm init
$ npm install
```
- create a .env file with the following properties:
REACT_APP_API_KEY = "key" // MovieDB API key

Inside the folder use the following command lines to run the server locally:
```sh
$ npm start
```

## Stack
- React (create-react-app)
- axios for managing api calls
- Material-ui for styling
- MovieDB API for movie information

## Heroku
The application can be found on Heroku under https://movie-finder-challenge.herokuapp.com/
